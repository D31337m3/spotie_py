Spotie.c - Program Setup and Signal Handling

This code represents the initial setup of a Spotify controller program. Let me break down what it does:

The code starts by including necessary libraries that provide functionality for input/output (stdio.h), memory management (stdlib.h), string handling (string.h), D-Bus communication (dbus.h), system calls (unistd.h), and signal handling (signal.h).

The program sets up a way to gracefully handle program termination through a global variable running and a signal handler function. When someone tries to stop the program (like pressing Ctrl+C), instead of abruptly closing, the signal_handler function sets running to 0, allowing the program to shut down cleanly.

The main function takes two inputs:

argc: The number of command-line arguments
argv: An array of strings containing the actual arguments
The code also includes the beginning of an Easter egg feature (a hidden surprise) that prints some decorative text when triggered, though the function is not complete in the shown snippet.

The program achieves its purpose by:

Setting up signal handlers for both interrupt (SIGINT) and termination (SIGTERM) signals
Using the running variable as a flag to control program execution
Preparing to handle user input through command-line arguments
The main logic flow is straightforward - when the program starts, it sets up signal handlers to catch user interrupts, allowing for graceful shutdown rather than abrupt termination. This is particularly important for programs that need to clean up resources (like closing connections) before exiting.

This code serves as the foundation for a larger program that will interact with Spotify through D-Bus communication, as indicated by the inclusion of the dbus.h header.
